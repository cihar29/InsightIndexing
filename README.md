# Summary

I used Spark to create an inverted index from a set of text files. Each word is given an a unique id. We keep track of which files the words appear in, and output the unique id followed by a list of files.

# Setup

Install pyspark, get [index files](https://github.com/Samariya57/coding_challenges/tree/master/data/indexing), and run.
